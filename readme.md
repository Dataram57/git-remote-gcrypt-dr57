# git-remote-gcrypt-dr57

This is a fork of [git-remote-gcrypt](https://github.com/spwhitton/git-remote-gcrypt) tool that puts absolute stealth on top of the hierarchy of goals. By stealth I mean "fitting in", and not necessearly anonymity.

Please read the old [readme](./old_README.rst) for more details and instructions.

## Important changes

* remote urls now must use `gcrypt-dr57::` instead of `gcrypt::`.

## Feauters

* Pushes now use the current timestamp and locally defined user.
* Custom `Manifestfile` name defined in the remote url:
    - Scheme: `gcrypt-dr57::REMOTE_URL#MANIFEST_FILE_NAME#`.
    - Scheme with specific branch: `gcrypt-dr57::REMOTE_URL#MANIFEST_FILE_NAME#BRANCHNAME`.
    - Example: `gcrypt-dr57::https://github.com/Dataram57/test#my_manifest_file#my_branch_name#`. Note that you must
    - Example with specific branch: `gcrypt-dr57::https://github.com/Dataram57/test#my_manifest_file#my_branch_name`.
    - ***Note that if branch name is not meant to be specified make sure `#` is also at the end of the url (enables compatibility with main source)***
